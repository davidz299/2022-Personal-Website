# Personal Website

Hi, I'm Chen (David) Zhuang and this is my old personal website developed using Javascript, CSS and HTML. Also implemented Bootstrap 5 to design the interface and architecture, as well as jQuery for event handling, including Ajax for a light-weight contact request form.

Check out my new website at http://www.chendavidzhuang.com/! The code for my new website is a repository named chendavidzhuang.com.
